<h1 align="center">> qNoNG Downloader 1.2 <</h1>

This is just a port of [paroxysms](https://github.com/paroxysms/nong-downloader-extension/) version.

Now code in C++ and it works on MH7, lol.
This version is not conflicted with other mods. By that you can use qNong with any mods :)
If you have any questions or have ideas for improving qNong, dms me on Discord "qDulfy#2655".
